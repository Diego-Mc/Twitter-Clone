# 💡 Why Wewix?

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wewix/image/upload/v1671065026/readme%20gifs/md-hero-wewix_c52ly2.gif">
</div>

As alumni of Coding Academy, a coding bootcamp, we wanted to challenge ourselves and showcase our skills by tackling a difficult project. We were inspired by the success of previous Wix clone projects and saw areas where they could be improved. We decided to create our own version of a web app similar to Wix, a popular website builder, as our final project in the bootcamp (called Sprint 4), and called it "wewix". We wanted to create a better version that focused on great design, a great user experience, and a solid foundation that would allow us to add a lot of features while keeping the app stable.

In just 12 days, we worked tirelessly to code and design a user-friendly and feature-rich platform using Mongo, Node, Vue, and Express. Our goal was to make wewix as easy and intuitive to use as possible, so that anyone, regardless of their technical expertise, could create and customize their own professional-looking website.

Although wewix was created as a project for Coding Academy and not a real product, we are proud of what we have accomplished and hope that it can serve as an example of our capabilities as aspiring full stack developers.

# 🚀 &nbsp;Getting Started
Are you interested in exploring the Wewix project and experimenting with its code? Great! In this section, we will show you how to clone the project and get started.

First, make sure you have the necessary tools installed on your computer, such as a code editor, a terminal, and Git.

Then, follow these steps to clone the project and run it locally:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
2. Clone the frontend repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Diego-Mc/wewix.git
```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd wewix
```
4. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
5. Start the development server (should start on port 5173):
```
npm start
```
6. Clone the backend repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Diego-Mc/wewix-backend.git
```
7. Navigate to the backend directory:
```
cd wewix-backend
```
8.  Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
9.  Start the development server (should start on port 3030):
```
npm start
```


You should now be able to access the Wewix app in your web browser at the local development URL (http://localhost:5173 for the frontend and http://localhost:3030 for the backend). You can experiment with the code and make changes as you like. Just be sure to commit your changes and push them to your own fork of the project if you want to save them.

Happy coding!
